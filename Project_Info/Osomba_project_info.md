# Project Deliverables (Updated)

## 📄 Project Description

The **Osomba Marketplace App** is a multi-category digital marketplace designed to connect buyers and sellers across several African countries. The platform will support secure online transactions through widely used fintech solutions, including **MPESA, AirtelMoney, Paystack, and cryptocurrency payments**. The application will be built for Android, backed by a scalable backend infrastructure, and will provide multilingual support in both English and French.

### New business features:

*   **Funnel & E-Boutique for Sellers:** personalized storefronts (e-boutiques) with shareable funnels and basic A/B testing.
*   **CRM (Customer Relationship Management):** contacts, segments, pipeline stages, tasks, and lightweight support tickets.
*   **Global Marketplace Integration (Multi-Platform Connectivity):** product/order/inventory sync with major channels (pilot with one, extensible to Amazon/eBay/Walmart/Alibaba).

**Combined vision:** “Africa’s first intelligent marketplace platform that empowers local sellers with personalized e-boutiques and data-driven marketing tools, with connectivity to global channels.”

### Key challenges include:

*   Building secure and seamless payment integrations with multiple fintech APIs.
*   Designing an intuitive, user-friendly interface for a diverse audience.
*   Implementing real-time buyer-seller communication and notifications.
*   Supporting multiple languages while maintaining consistent functionality.
*   Ensuring the platform can scale effectively as demand grows.
*   Enabling seller funnels, CRM workflows, and external channel synchronization.
